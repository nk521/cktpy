|            cheap_visualizer           |                                         IT ACTUALLY LOOKS COOOOOOOOOOOOOL! But 10 neopixels are way less.                                         |

|             rubber_python             | Because there was nothing like this. So I made one!  Till now It only supports 2 mode but you can use on-board switch to make it support 4 modes. |
| somewhat_good_ambient_lighting_thingy |                                          No ints in circuit python so polling was the only workaround :(                                          |
